Hi I'm Phil, a second year masters student at Carnegie Mellon Univeristy expected to graduate in December 2022. I am interested in cloud computing, web development, and IoT development. I enjoy working on projects that mix principles of engineering and software development which is why I chose to study Mobile and Internet of Things Engineering at CMU. I have a strong background in C++, Java, and web development using React.js, JavaScript, and PHP.
